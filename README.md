# IBDP-SIMS: Personal Performance Optimization Platform

> **Note from the developer:** I built this application at 17 as my final project (Internal Assessment) for the IBDP Computer Science HL course. It was designed and developed from the ground up for a specific client, a student who needed a digital solution to a chaotic and inefficient paper-based workflow. This project represents my passion for solving real-world problems with technology and showcases my early skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and client-centric product development.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This platform integrates several key modules into a unified, interactive dashboard to create a "mission control" for a student's academic and personal life.

- **Dynamic Window Manager (`WorkStage`):** A custom-built 'stage manager' interface allowing users to create multiple workspaces ("Spaces"), each containing draggable, resizable, and interactive windows for true multitasking.
- **Kanban-Style To-Do List:** A feature-rich task manager with sections, columns, and draggable notes and sub-tasks, enabling complex project and workflow organization.
- **Cookie Jar:** A motivational tool inspired by David Goggins, allowing users to save and organize snippets of achievements and affirmations in a flexible, sortable grid layout.
- **Idea & Doubt Trackers:** Two dedicated, Reddit-inspired modules for logging, tracking, and resolving ideas and doubts, complete with voting, nested commenting, and resolution features.
- **Continuous Information Space:** A digital notebook system for creating and managing long-form documents with a flexible, multi-column hierarchical structure.
- **Unified Dashboard:** All modules can be viewed together in a central, resizable dashboard, providing a bird's-eye view of all your information.

## üîí Key Technical Concepts & Security Implementation

Beyond the features, this project demonstrates a strong understanding of fundamental software architecture and security principles.

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization (`middleware.ts`)**

- **Secure by Default:** The application uses **Clerk's middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`) to protect all routes by default. Publicly accessible routes, like the `/sign-in` page, are explicitly whitelisted.
- **Route Protection:** The `auth().protect()` function ensures that no unauthenticated user can access any part of the application, preventing unauthorized data access.

### 2. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation in Firestore**

- **Per-User Scoping:** The application architecture strictly isolates data on a per-user basis. The Firestore schema is designed so that a user's data is always stored under a path scoped to their unique user ID (e.g., `collection(db, "users", user.id, "nugget")` in `DoubtTracker.tsx`).
- **Prevents Data Leakage:** This pattern is a critical security measure in multi-tenant applications, making it architecturally impossible for one user to access another user's data through backend queries.

### 3. **Secure Server-Side Logic with Zod Validation**

- **Server Actions:** All database mutations (create, update, delete) are handled exclusively through **Next.js Server Actions** located in `src/lib/*-actions.ts`.
- **No Direct DB Access from Client:** The client-side components call these server actions but never interact with the database directly. This abstracts away the database logic and prevents malicious users from attempting to manipulate the database from the browser.
- **Input Validation:** **Zod schemas** (e.g., `CookieSchema`) are used to validate the shape and type of data before it's written to the database, ensuring data integrity and preventing malformed data from being saved.

### 4. **Bespoke UI/UX from Client-Centric Research**

- **Work Shadowing:** Observing the client's physical workflow of laying out multiple paper sheets directly inspired the **Stage Manager** module, providing a digital "mission control" for multitasking.
- **Familiar UI Patterns:** The client's frequent use of Reddit inspired the card-based layout, voting system, and nested comments in the **Doubt Tracker** and **Curiosity Space**, significantly reducing the learning curve.

### 5. **Advanced State Management & Performance**

- **Real-time Synchronization:** The application uses **Firebase Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener** to establish a real-time, bidirectional data flow. Any change made in the database is instantly reflected in the UI across all logged-in devices.
- **Debounced Database Writes:** For continuous input (like typing in a notebook), `useEffect` and `setTimeout` create a debounced save function. This optimizes performance by batching rapid UI updates into less frequent database writes, reducing Firestore costs and network traffic.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The codebase is organized logically within the `src/` directory:

- `src/app/`: Contains the main page routes and layouts, following the Next.js App Router structure. Each feature (like `CookieJar`, `ToDoList`) has its own page.
- `src/components/`: Home to the reusable React components that make up the UI. This includes:
  - `ui/`: Base UI components from Shadcn/UI.
  - Feature-specific folders (e.g., `curiosity-space`, `doubts-tracker`, `stage-manager`) containing the logic and UI for each module.
- `src/lib/`: Core application logic, including:
  - `firebase.ts`: Firebase initialization and configuration.
  - `*-actions.ts`: All the Server Actions for database interaction.
  - `utils.ts`: Utility functions.
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks used throughout the application.
- `src/middleware.ts`: The Clerk authentication middleware for route protection.
