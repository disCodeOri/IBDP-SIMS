### Discord (r/IBDP45) - The Engine Room

**Purpose:** To facilitate focused collaboration, real-time interaction, accountability partnerships, and personalized progress tracking through the `crac45` bot.

**Server Structure:**

* **Welcome & Rules:**  Channel for new members with clear guidelines and instructions.
* **Announcements:**  For important updates and information from moderators.
* **General Discussion:**  A casual space for community chatter (with potential slow mode).
* **Subject Channels:** Dedicated channels for each IB subject, mirroring Reddit but with a more immediate discussion format.
* **Study Groups:**  Channels for students taking the same subjects to collaborate on specific topics or assignments.
* **Accountability Hub:**  The central channel for progress updates and buddy interactions.
  * Dedicated individual threads for each member (see below).
* **Pomodoro/Study Rooms (VC):** Voice channels for focused study sessions with `crac45` tracking.
* **Music Lounge (VC):** A voice channel for playing music using `crac45`.
* **Bot Commands:**  A designated channel for interacting with the `crac45` bot.
* **Staff Channels:** Private channels for moderators and admins.

**Initial data collection on members when they join**
(they are mandated to answer these questions and cannot proceed to the server unless they have answered)

* Subject selections
* Current student or alumni?
* Current grades or alumni grades
* Data collection for automated personal AI generated msgs from the bot to painfully remind the user about their goals when performance drops and their excuse isn't something valid.
  * Purpose of joining the community (what do you hope to achieve?)
  * Why do you want to achieve that? OR What drives you to achieve that?
  * What made you pick this goal up?
  * Why do you think you are qualified?

**Individual Progress Threads:**

* **Purpose:** Each member gets a personal thread within the "Accountability Hub" channel.
* **Functionality:**
  * Members post daily or regular progress updates on their study goals and achievements.
  * Buddies can provide encouragement and feedback within these threads.
  * The `crac45` bot can potentially summarize progress or highlight trends over time.

**Assigned Buddies for Accountability:**

* **Matching Algorithm:** The `crac45` bot will pair members based on factors like subjects taken, time zone, current grades, and stated availability.
* **Accountability Checkups:**
  * The bot sends regular reminders to buddies to check in with each other.
  * Suggested check-up questions: "What are your goals for today/this week?", "What challenges are you facing?", "How can I support you?", "Did you complete your planned tasks?".
* **Buddy Communication:**  Buddies can communicate within their individual progress threads or in direct messages.

**Competitive Sprints:**

* **Buddy vs. Buddy:** Individuals compete against their assigned buddy on task completion or study time over a set period.
* **Buddy Pair vs. Buddy Pair:** Teams of two buddies compete against another team.
* **Tournaments:** Server wide study marathons. (people can either participate in buddy pairs or go in individually for an extra gruesome challenge)
  * "Frenzy Friday" - buddy pair vs buddy pair marathons (this happens on the discord actually, not the reddit page)
* **Tracking and Scoring:** The `crac45` bot tracks progress based on input from members. Scoring can be based on the number of tasks completed, study time accumulated, or a combination.
* **Rewards (Optional):**  Consider implementing a simple reward system (e.g., bragging rights, special Discord roles).

**`crac45` Bot Functionality:**

* **Buddy Management:**
  * Assignment and reassignment of buddies (manual override for specific requests).
  * Sending reminder messages for accountability checkups.
  * Facilitating competitive sprints and tracking scores.
* **Streaks and Point-Based Progress:**
  * Tracking daily/weekly study streaks.
  * Point system for task completion (preset values or buddy-assigned).
  * Leaderboards (optional, may foster unhealthy competition for some).
* **Reporting to Batcave:**  Data on study sessions, task completion, and potentially energy levels will be sent to the web portal.
* **VC Functionality:**
  * **Study Time Tracker:** Tracks time spent in designated study voice channels.
  * **Break Recording:**
    * Basic: Members send a command like `!break start` and `!break end`.
    * Advanced: Keyword listening for common break-related phrases (e.g., "brb," "taking a break"). Accuracy and privacy need careful consideration.
  * **Music Streaming:** Plays music from Spotify links within the VC. Ensure bot permissions and stability.
  * **Auto VC creation and deletion:** For Grp study sessions of 3-4 or 5-6 ppl the bot will create a special VC channel as per commnad for the members of that particular group (called through "@" mentions). (the bot will create VC roles for that grp study instance and then assign those roles to the grp study members and then they will be able to join the grp VC).
* **Slow Mode Control:** Dynamically adjusts slow mode based on message rate in channels to manage chat flow.

### Batcave Web Portal - Personalized Analytics and Insights

**Purpose:** To provide community members with a personalized dashboard offering insights into their study habits and progress.

**Account System:**

* **Discord Account Sign-up:**  Leveraging Discord's OAuth2 for authentication is the most seamless option for users. Research Discord Developer Portal for implementation details and limitations. Potential limitations might include requiring user authorization for specific scopes (e.g., identifying user, accessing server information).
* **Alternative (If Discord Login Limited):** Email/password registration, linked to their Discord username for matching data.

**Analytics Dashboard:**

* **Discord Study Session Analytics:**
  * **Marty Lobdell Energy Graph:** Visual representation of energy levels recorded during study sessions, plotted against time. Calculate optimal break points based on dips in energy. This requires storing timestamps and energy level ratings. (The bot will periodically send polls to the VC chat where the people in the VC can rate their energy levels)
  * **Productivity Report:**
    * **Tasks Completed:**  Visual display of completed tasks from a user's planned list (needs a mechanism for users to input their planned tasks, potentially through the bot or web portal).
    * **Expected, Acceptable Failure, and Stretch Rates:** Display these user-defined parameters alongside their actual completion rate for comparison and motivation.

**Data Flow:**

1. Users interact with the `crac45` bot on Discord, providing data on study sessions, breaks, and task completion.
2. The `crac45` bot sends this data to the Batcave web portal database (requires a backend infrastructure).
3. The web portal uses this data to generate personalized analytics and visualizations.

**UI Design (High-Level):**

* Clean and intuitive interface.
* Personalized dashboard upon login.
* Clear visualizations (charts, graphs, progress bars).
* Separate sections for study session analytics and productivity reports.

### More Stuff for Discord

**Slow Mode Control Bot:**

* **Functionality:** Monitors message rate in channels and automatically adjusts slow mode duration.
* **Configuration:** Allow moderators to set thresholds for message rates and corresponding slow mode durations.

**Staff:**

* **Roles:**
  * **Admin:** Highest level of permissions, responsible for overall server management, bot configurations, and major decisions.
  * **Moderator:** Enforces rules, manages channels, addresses user issues, and generally maintains the community environment.
  * **Trial Moderator:**  New moderators undergoing a probationary period.
* **Staff Applications:**
  * **Requirements:**
    * Demonstrated understanding of the server's workings and goals.
    * Emotional maturity and the ability to handle conflicts fairly.
    * Sound judgment for issuing appropriate punishments.
    * Active participation in the community.
* **Staff Security:**
  * **2FA Enabled:** Mandatory for all staff accounts.
  * **Seed Phrases for Account Migrations related moderator role shifting requests:**  While useful for personal crypto wallets, this might be overly complex for Discord account recovery. Discord's built-in 2FA and recovery methods are usually sufficient. Focus on strong, unique passwords and secure 2FA setup.
* **Staff Satisfaction:**
  * Designated private channels for staff communication and support.
  * Regular discussions about server issues and improvements.
  * Acknowledging and appreciating staff contributions.
  * Encouraging staff to take breaks to avoid burnout.

**Server Size Limits & Branch Servers:**

* **Initial Limit:** 3000 members (excluding staff).
* **Rationale:** Maintaining a smaller, more intimate community fosters stronger connections and higher-quality interactions.
* **Branch Servers (Hogwarts Houses Analogy):**
  * **Implementation:** If the community grows beyond the limit, consider creating separate Discord servers ("houses") with their own moderators, while maintaining a central "hub" server for announcements and overall community events.
  * **House Assignment:** Could be based on subject combinations, time zones, or even a random sorting mechanism.
  * **Inter-Server Communication:**  Explore bot integrations to allow communication and events across branch servers.

### IBDP CS HL IA Complexity Mapping

Now, let's meticulously map the planned features to the IBDP CS HL IA complexity criteria. This is crucial for demonstrating the technical depth of your project.

<table width="1023">
    <tr>
        <td align="center"  >
            Complexity Aspect
        </td>
        <td align="center">
            How `crac45` Addresses It
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Adding data to an instance of the `RandomAccessFile` class by direct manipulation of the file pointer using the `seek` method.
        </td>
        <td>
            While not directly using `RandomAccessFile`, the bot will be managing and updating user data (progress, buddy assignments, study streaks, points) persistently. This could potentially involve using file I/O or database interactions that conceptually involve navigating and modifying data storage, although the specific implementation might use more modern methods.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Deleting data from an instance of the `RandomAccessFile` class by direct manipulation of the file pointer using the `seek` method.
        </td>
        <td>
            Similar to adding data, managing user data will involve deleting or marking data as inactive (e.g., when a user leaves the community or resets their progress). The underlying mechanisms, whether file-based or database-driven, will necessitate data removal.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Searching for specified data in a file
        </td>
        <td>
            The bot will need to search for specific user data (e.g., finding a user by their Discord ID for buddy assignment, retrieving progress data for reporting). This involves implementing search algorithms, whether linear, binary, or database-optimized queries.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Recursion
        </td>
        <td>
            Potentially used in algorithms for tasks like traversing hierarchical data structures (if used for storing community data or buddy relationships), or in more advanced features like calculating optimal break times using recursive analysis of energy level data.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Merging two or more sorted data structures
        </td>
        <td>
            Could be used when combining data from different sources (e.g., merging study time logs with task completion records for a comprehensive productivity report) or when implementing features like combined leaderboards from different "house" servers.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Polymorphism
        </td>
        <td>
            Can be employed in the bot's design, for example, if different types of progress updates or tasks require different handling methods, or if different notification systems are implemented through a common interface.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Inheritance
        </td>
        <td>
            Useful in structuring the bot's code. For example, creating a base `User` class with common attributes and then extending it for specific user types (e.g., `CommunityMember`, `Moderator`). Different types of tasks or events could also be modeled with inheritance.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Encapsulation
        </td>
        <td>
            A fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, which will be used extensively throughout the bot's codebase to organize data and methods within classes, hiding internal implementation details and promoting modularity.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Parsing a text file or other data stream
        </td>
        <td>
            Likely involved in processing user input from Discord commands, reading configuration files, or potentially parsing data from external APIs (e.g., Spotify for music streaming).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Implementing a hierarchical composite data structure.
        </td>
        <td>
            Representing the community structure itself (e.g., servers, channels, users) or buddy relationships can involve hierarchical data structures. Storing planned tasks with subtasks could also utilize this.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Use of additional libraries
        </td>
        <td>
            Definitely. Discord.py library for bot interaction, libraries for database interaction (e.g., SQLAlchemy, psycopg2), libraries for data visualization (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn), potentially libraries for audio processing (for advanced break detection), and libraries for handling API requests (e.g., requests).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Inserting data into an ordered sequential file without reading the entire file into RAM
        </td>
        <td>
            If using file-based storage for certain data, implementing efficient insertion methods that avoid loading the entire file will demonstrate this complexity. Database systems handle this inherently.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Deleting data from a sequential file without reading the entire file into RAM
        </td>
        <td>
            Similar to insertion, efficient deletion in file-based storage contributes to complexity.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Arrays of two or more dimensions.
        </td>
        <td>
            Potentially used in representing data like study schedules, tracking progress across multiple days/weeks, or storing data for the Marty Lobdell energy graph (time x energy level).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
        </td>
        <td>
            The project offers several opportunities for implementing ADTs:<br>
            - Lists (Dynamically Linked):  Could be used to manage lists of users, tasks, or buddy assignments. Implementing methods for adding, removing, and traversing nodes would fulfill this.<br>
            - Tree (Simple Ordered Binary Tree):  Potentially for organizing user data for efficient searching or for representing hierarchical relationships (though other data structures might be more suitable depending on the exact requirements).<br>
            - Stack: Could be used for managing undo/redo operations or for specific algorithms within the bot.<br>
            - Queue: Useful for managing tasks or events that need to be processed in a specific order.<br>
            - Hash Table: Ideal for storing and retrieving user data based on their Discord ID, enabling fast lookups for buddy assignments, progress tracking, etc. Implementing collision handling is key.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

**Non-Triviality:**  Crucially, you must demonstrate that the use of each of these aspects genuinely benefits the program and isn't just included for the sake of ticking a box. Document how each complex feature contributes to the functionality and efficiency of the `crac45` bot and the IBDP 45 community system.
