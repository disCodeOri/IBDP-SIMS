# The Unintentional System

- Identify the Core Components: What were the essential elements of that period of intense motivation?
- Clear Benchmarks (albeit relative): The performance of the senior batch and your immediate peers provided tangible targets.
- Measurable Progress: You could directly compare your performance against these benchmarks.
- A Sense of Urgency/Competition (internal): The desire to rapidly surpass others fueled your efforts.
- Tangible Feedback (even in dryland): The dryland workouts offered direct comparisons and a sense of improvement.
- Enjoyment of the Process: While driven by competition, you also genuinely enjoyed the act of swimming and training.
- Competition: a tangible sense of competition with someone that is not too far off from your performance level once you beat that person, you move onto the next competitor that is, again, just a wee bit better than you, but enough so that you struggle to win against them.
- Rigid environment where there is no possibility of deviation from the work that needs to be done.
