# Simplified Project Outline: Student Life Management App

## Core Features:
1. Basic Scheduler
   - Create, view, and manage tasks
   - Set due dates and priorities

2. Simple Note-Taking
   - Create and edit notes
   - Organize notes by subject

3. Study Session Tracker
   - Log study sessions
   - View basic statistics on study time

## Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React (easier to learn, widely used)
- Backend: Node.js with Express (JavaScript throughout)
- Database: SQLite (simpler to set up than PostgreSQL)

## Phase 1 (MVP):
1. User Authentication
2. Basic Scheduler functionality
3. Simple Note-Taking feature
4. Study Session logging

## Phase 2 (If time allows):
1. Basic analytics on study sessions
2. Improved note organization (tags, search)
3. Calendar view for scheduler

## Phase 3 (Future expansion):
1. Integration with external calendars
2. Advanced scheduling algorithms
3. Expanded analytics

This simplified outline focuses on the core functionality while still providing a solid foundation for future expansion. It demonstrates key programming concepts and database management, suitable for a CS IA project.
