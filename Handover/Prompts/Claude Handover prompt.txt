//prompt for spawned AI(i.e. AI that is newly made with a fresh set of prompts available)
I need to make a CS IA Application and here is the document that details all the things that I noted down, that I wanted in the application.

In a previous chat the AI and I have worked together to build the application so far. I want you to traverse this file and fully understand each and every aspect that is mentioned in the attached document. So that you can pick up and continue where the previous AI left off.

I may also attach another set of documents that contain all the code that has been made so far. I have omitted the package-lock.json file as it is extremely large but if you need it then I will be happy to share it with you.





//prompt for dying AI(i.e. AI that is running out of messages)
I am running out of messages to give to you and hence I want you to collate all the information you have about the application, the plans, the requirements of the application, all information about me, and literally every other detail about the application so far. Also include details about the project structure (the files, the names of those files and what they contain), also include metadata about the project such as the settings enabled during the initial project setup process, the progress of the applciation so far and the project development roadmap that we are currently following right now.

The purpose of this collated document is to be shared with another AI model who is not aware about the project at all, but is required to essentially continue where the previous AI (that is you) left off.
