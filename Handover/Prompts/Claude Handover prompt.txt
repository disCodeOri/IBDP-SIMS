//prompt for spawned AI(i.e. AI that is newly made with a fresh set of prompts available)






//prompt for dying AI(i.e. AI that is running out of messages)
I am running out of messages to give to you and hence I want you to collate all the information you have about the application, the plans, the requirements of the application, all information about me, and literally every other detail about the application so far. Also include details about the project structure (the files, the names of those files and what they contain), also include metadata about the project such as the settings enabled during the initial project setup process, the progress of the applciation so far and the project development roadmap that we are currently following right now.

The purpose of this collated document is to be shared with another AI model who is not aware about the project at all, but is required to essentially continue where the previous AI (that is you) left off.
