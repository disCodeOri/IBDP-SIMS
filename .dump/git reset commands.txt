1. Undo the commit but keep changes unstaged (default behavior):
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```
Your files remain modified but unstaged.

2. Undo the commit and completely discard the changes:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
⚠️ Warning: This deletes all changes from the last commit permanently.

3.Undo the commit but keep changes staged (for re-committing):

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
Your changes stay staged, ready to amend or recommit.
