# Internal assessment details—SL and HL
## Rationale
Internal assessment in economics enables students to demonstrate the application of their knowledge and understanding of economic theory to real-world situations.

## Requirements
Both SL and HL economics students produce a portfolio of three commentaries based on articles from published news media. Each article must be based on a different section of the syllabus (microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics and development economics).

## Focus
Each commentary must:
- explain the linkages between the article and economic theory taken from the section of the syllabus on which the article is based
- demonstrate economic insights into the implications of the article (that is, it should provide evidence of the student’s ability to discuss current events from the point of view of an economist).

On each commentary students must record:
- the title of the article
- the source of the article (including date of access to the site if from the internet)
- the date the article was published
- the date the commentary was written
- the word count of the commentary
- the section of the syllabus to which the article relates.

# Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL
## Overview
There are five internal assessment criteria for each commentary.

Criterion A | Diagrams | 3 marks
Criterion B | Terminology | 2 marks
Criterion C | Application | 2 marks
Criterion D | Analysis | 3 marks
Criterion E | Evaluation | 4 marks

Total- 14 marks
