International Economics:
P1 - describe the article in 1-2 sentences then define the key terms 3-4 sentences total

Diagram1: tariff diagram

P2 - Advantages of the imposition of advantages (~200-300 words) - need to backup with evidence from the IA/Article
- Reduces current account deficit
- Increase in Aggregate Demand, imports decrease
- Decreases govt. deficit 
- Protection of infant industries - allows them to achieve economies of scale in order to compete with foreign firms.
- reduces domestic unemployment.

P3 - Disadvantages of Tariff imposition (~200-300 words) - need to backup with evidence from the IA/Article
- leads to retaliations from other countries - reduces exports for the country imposing tariffs - If this happens then the advantage of increases in AD would be voided. (trade war)
- leads to a higher price level of imports - harms retailers.
- loss in efficiency - domestic production increases and imports decrease - during the process, the producers that were the most efficient at production may be replaced by less efficient domestic producers.
- consumer surplus loss - as price increases, less is demanded, loss in consumer surplus
- loss in consumer choice
- decreases in technological advances implemented domestically - any technological advancements may not be implemented by domestic firms.

adaptable conclusion statement:
- A tariff reduces unemployment and current account deficit in the short run but in the long run it causes losses in efficiency and technological advances, not to mention the rise of trade wars between countries. And therefore a tariff is not a feasible long run solution.
