The audio describes a plan to create a high-scoring (14/14) Economics IA (Internal Assessment) commentary for the IB Diploma Programme, specifically focusing on macroeconomics, using an AI writing tool.  Here's a breakdown of the process:

**Phase 1: Pre-AI Preparation**

1. **Article Selection:** Find a suitable news article about a macroeconomic issue.  If the article is long, choose a specific section relevant to the commentary's focus.
2. **Bias Identification:** Analyze the article for biases presented by different stakeholders (e.g., government, private companies).  Identify instances where opinions might be influenced by internal biases or ulterior motives. This is crucial for the critical analysis component of the IA.
3. **Idea Collection and Organization:** Create a detailed "project document."  Compile all ideas, arguments, graphs/diagrams, and key points from the article analysis that will be used in the commentary. This document will serve as the input for the AI.

**Phase 2: AI-Assisted Drafting and Refinement**

1. **AI Input:** Feed the project document into an AI writing tool capable of high-quality writing.
2. **AI Prompting:** Instruct the AI to emulate the style, coherence, and overall quality expected of a 14/14 IA commentary. The audio doesn't mention specifics, but the idea is to train the model as well as you can to maximize effectiveness.
3. **Draft Generation:** Have the AI generate a draft commentary.
4. **Draft Evaluation:**  Assess the generated draft.  If it meets the desired quality, proceed to fine-tuning.  If not:
    * Retry/regenerate within the AI, potentially adjusting settings or using different prompting strategies to ensure accuracy and thoroughness.  
    * Modify the original project document to make it clearer and provide more specific instructions to the AI.
5. **Iteration:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a satisfactory draft is achieved.  This iterative process involves fine-tuning prompts and project document adjustments, with increasing accuracy and thoroughness to increase the chance of meeting expectations.

**Phase 3: Expert Feedback and Finalization**

1. **Expert Review:** Send the near-final draft to an experienced Economics teacher or tutor ("Vijay Sir" in the audio) for feedback based on IB marking criteria (rubrics). The prompt implied having an existing mentor you're going to rely on in the grading process, I kept that dynamic here but remember any person you find that meets the criteria might work out in this respect.
2. **Feedback Integration:**  Convert the feedback into AI-compatible prompts to address weaknesses in the writing/analysis of the commentary.  The audio mentions creating specific formatted instructions related to specific weaknesses and putting it in optimal form related to prompting structures. It is suggested the AI model could work out from there with these inputs.
3. **AI Refinement:**  Use the feedback-driven prompts to regenerate and refine the draft within the AI.
4. **Final Iteration:** Loop through steps 1-3 until the IA meets desired level. You can end with an IA at a quality of either "a 14 out of 14" (per prompt) or when it becomes "satisfactory to your ego."

**Key Considerations for Using AI:**

* **Prompt Engineering:**  The success of this process heavily relies on how well you create prompts in stages related to document and refinement phases for the chosen AI tool. Be very precise and descriptive, focusing on specific areas the feedback indicated were problematic related to formatting, structure, etc.
* **AI Capabilities:** Select an AI capable of sophisticated writing and ideally fine-tuned for academic tasks, rather than being fine-tuned across diverse general cases of information from training sets.
* **Ethical Use:** Ensure the AI is used ethically as a support tool, with credit given and plagiarism avoided as you deem fit with the particular rules of the competition. The IA ultimately should represent your understanding of the material as supported by the AI assistant's generated output.

Let me know if you'd like me to help create any of these project document layouts for fine-tuning. You can start describing things to help create and flesh this plan out even more from this basis, since no prior context was indicated in the prompt but that it may potentially be continued at any stage related to planning or draft making.
