### Introduction (150 words)
The demolition of 90-acre Government Colony in Bandra East, Mumbai, presents a compelling case study of sustainability challenges in urban redevelopment. While the project aims to modernize government housing through the construction of new high-rises, it has generated significant negative externalities affecting nearby residents and businesses. This article explores how the demolition process, which began in August, has failed to implement mandated environmental protection measures, leading to severe dust pollution and health impacts on the local community. The case demonstrates how market failure through negative externalities can compromise both environmental and social sustainability, necessitating more effective government intervention.

### Explanation of the Economic Theory (200 words)
The concept of negative externalities is central to this case. In the context of urban redevelopment:

- **Market Failure**: The demolition company and government authorities do not bear the full social costs of their activities. The external costs are borne by:
  - Neighboring residents experiencing health issues
  - Local businesses facing disruption
  - The broader community affected by environmental degradation

- MSC (Marginal Social Cost) > MPC (Marginal Private Cost)
- The difference represents external costs (dust pollution, health impacts)
- Optimal market outcome vs. current situation

### Application of the Theory (250 words)
The case demonstrates multiple failures in addressing negative externalities:

1. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**:
   - BMC guidelines mandate full coverage of demolition sites
   - Only 10-feet of the sites were covered
   - Inadequate water spraying for dust control

2. **Impact Quantification**:
   - Respiratory health issues reported by residents
   - Property damage from falling debris
   - Business disruption for local shops
   - Sleep deprivation from extended work hours

3. **Market Failure Evidence**:
   - No compensation mechanism for affected parties
   - Absence of preventive measures despite known risks
   - Externalization of health costs to local community

### Evaluation (200 words)
Short-term Solutions:
- Immediate enforcement of existing BMC guidelines
- Installation of proper barriers and dust control measures
- Regular monitoring and inspection
- Compensation mechanism for affected residents

Long-term Recommendations:
1. Policy Reform:
   - Stricter enforcement mechanisms
   - Higher penalties for non-compliance
   - Mandatory health impact assessments

2. Market-Based Solutions:
   - Environmental performance bonds
   - Insurance requirements for contractors
   - Integrated cost accounting for externalities

Limitations:
- Challenge of balancing development needs with environmental protection
- Cost implications of stricter regulations
- Enforcement capacity constraints
