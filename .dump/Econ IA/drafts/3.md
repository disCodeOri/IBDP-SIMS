### Introduction (150 words)
The demolition of 90-acre Government Colony in Bandra East, Mumbai, presents a compelling case study of sustainability challenges in urban redevelopment. While the project aims to modernize government housing through the construction of new high-rises, it has generated significant negative externalities affecting nearby residents and businesses. This article explores how the demolition process, which began in August, has failed to implement mandated environmental protection measures, leading to severe dust pollution and health impacts on the local community. The case demonstrates how market failure through negative externalities can compromise both environmental and social sustainability, necessitating more effective government intervention. This analysis will examine the economic implications of inadequate environmental protection measures in urban development projects and evaluate potential solutions through the lens of sustainability.

### Explanation of the Economic Theory (250 words)
The concept of negative externalities is central to this case. In the context of urban redevelopment, negative externalities occur when the social costs of an economic activity exceed the private costs borne by the producer. This market failure is particularly evident in construction and demolition projects where environmental impacts affect third parties.

In this case, the negative externalities manifest through:
1. Environmental Costs:
   - Air pollution from construction dust
   - Noise pollution affecting sleep patterns
   - Physical debris causing safety hazards

2. Health-Related Costs:
   - Respiratory problems reported by residents
   - Allergic reactions and chest congestion
   - Long-term health implications

3. Economic Costs:
   - Property damage
   - Business disruption
   - Increased cleaning and maintenance expenses

The market failure occurs because the demolition contractors and government authorities do not incorporate these external costs into their decision-making process. Without proper intervention, this leads to an oversupply of pollution and environmental degradation relative to the socially optimal level.

### Application of the Theory (200 words)
The case demonstrates multiple failures in addressing negative externalities:

1. Regulatory Non-Compliance:
   - BMC guidelines mandate full coverage of demolition sites
   - Only 10-feet of the sites were covered
   - Inadequate water spraying for dust control
   - Absence of warning signs and safety measures

2. Impact Quantification:
   - Multiple residents reporting respiratory issues
   - Property damage from falling debris
   - Business disruption for five local shops
   - Sleep deprivation from extended work hours
   - Structural impacts on neighboring buildings

3. Market Failure Evidence:
   - No compensation mechanism for affected parties
   - Absence of preventive measures despite known risks
   - Externalization of health costs to local community
   - Lack of accountability for guideline violations

The case particularly highlights how the absence of effective enforcement mechanisms allows contractors to externalize costs onto the community, creating a classic example of market failure in environmental protection.

### Evaluation (200 words)
Short-term Solutions:
1. Immediate Enforcement:
   - Strict implementation of existing BMC guidelines
   - Regular inspections and monitoring
   - Penalties for non-compliance
   
2. Protection Measures:
   - Installation of proper dust barriers
   - Implementation of water spraying systems
   - Restricted working hours to minimize disruption

3. Community Support:
   - Health monitoring for affected residents
   - Temporary relocation options
   - Compensation for business losses

Long-term Recommendations:
1. Policy Reform:
   - Stricter enforcement mechanisms
   - Higher penalties for non-compliance
   - Mandatory health impact assessments
   - Regular environmental audits

2. Market-Based Solutions:
   - Environmental performance bonds
   - Insurance requirements for contractors
   - Integrated cost accounting for externalities
   - Incentives for adopting cleaner technologies

Limitations and Considerations:
- Challenge of balancing development needs with environmental protection
- Cost implications of stricter regulations
- Enforcement capacity constraints
- Political feasibility of reforms
- Time constraints in urban development projects
